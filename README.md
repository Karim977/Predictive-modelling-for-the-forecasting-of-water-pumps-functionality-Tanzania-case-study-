# Predictive Modeling for Water Pump Operations in Tanzania

This project aims to develop a predictive modeling approach to accurately forecast the operational status of water pumps across Tanzania. Leveraging a robust dataset, our methodology integrates advanced machine learning algorithms, including deep learning and gradient boosting. 

## Key Features:
- **Robust Dataset**: Utilizes comprehensive data on water pump operations across Tanzania.
- **Machine Learning Algorithms**: Incorporates deep learning and gradient boosting techniques for accurate predictions.
- **Imbalanced Data Handling**: Addresses challenges posed by imbalanced data through preprocessing and feature engineering strategies.

Through this project, we strive to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of water pump maintenance operations, ultimately contributing to the accessibility of clean water in Tanzanian communities.
